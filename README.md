# PartyPlaylists

PartyPlaylists is an application currently being developed that gives you the ability to make your playlists more social, by allowing your friends to join your created rooms and add songs to a public playlist. Once songs are added to a partyplaylist room, you and your friends can upvote/downvote the order of the songs, which then show up in your spotify client, or you can stream them directly from the application!
